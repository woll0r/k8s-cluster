# K8S-GitOps

!!! warning
    These docs haven't been touched in a while, so they might be out of date.

This repository serves as the declarative "source of truth" for my Kubernetes
cluster at home. [Flux] watches over the
`cluster` folder to check for changes and apply them to the cluster.

The [k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s] repository served
as a loose base for things.
